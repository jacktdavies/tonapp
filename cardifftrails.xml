<p>I&#8217;ve been toying with the idea of doing in-depth reviews of my running gear but I have very little experience to compare it with other equipment. Instead, I&#8217;m just going to share what I currently use.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m not reviewing anything in detail and I&#8217;m not suggesting this is the best gear for you.</p>



<p>For context, I&#8217;m doing <a href="https://cardifftrails.com/category/run/">short to medium distance runs</a> in the local area. None of this equipment is for very specific or extreme conditions.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Shoes</h3>



<p>Peregrine 13<br>£78</p>



<p>I have a few shoes in rotation and I&#8217;ve been <a href="https://cardifftrails.com/tag/shoes/">testing different models</a> to see what other brands offer. The Peregrine series have been a favourite of mine since they were the first serious pair I bought. I found the latest model on sale and picked them up for a bargain £78.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve done 65 miles in the Peregrine 13s and I love them. It&#8217;s hard to recommend shoes because so much depends on your personal foot shape and preferred cushioning level but these get a thumbs up from me.</p>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-group ggimg has-global-padding is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="1006" src="https://149940842.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Shorts-1024x1006.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1023" srcset="https://149940842.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Shorts-1024x1006.png 1024w , https://149940842.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Shorts-300x295.png 300w , https://149940842.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Shorts-768x755.png 768w , https://149940842.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Shorts.png 1519w " sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Shorts</h3>



<p>Under Armor “Qualifier 2-in-1”<br>£25</p>



<p>I made the mistake a few years ago of running in short shorts and suffered from the dreaded chaffing! I&#8217;ve been wearing shorts with a built in compression layer for years and swear by them.</p>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-group has-global-padding is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Tops</h3>



<p>I&#8217;ve got loads of tops from various events and ones I&#8217;ve picked up on sale. Anything light and comfortable is fine for me.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve got one top that has an insulated chest, which is good for protecting you from the wind if you&#8217;re on the hills.</p>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-group ggimg has-global-padding is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="575" height="1024" src="https://149940842.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Socks-575x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1025" srcset="https://149940842.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Socks-575x1024.png 575w , https://149940842.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Socks-168x300.png 168w , https://149940842.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Socks-768x1369.png 768w , https://149940842.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Socks-862x1536.png 862w , https://149940842.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Socks.png 988w " sizes="(max-width: 575px) 100vw, 575px" /></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Socks</h3>



<p>Danish Endurance “Graduated Compression Socks”<br>£17</p>



<p>I started off buying some compression sleeves, which you wear in addition to regular socks. They&#8217;re designed to apply pressure which maintains blood flow and reduces discomfort.</p>



<p>I didn&#8217;t really feel any difference but I like having my legs protected from brambles and other sharp foliage.</p>



<p>I picked up some Danish Endurance compression socks and they&#8217;re great. I wear them for most runs in the winter and longer ones over the summer.</p>
</div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Accessories</h2>



<div class="wp-block-group has-global-padding is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large ggimg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="937" height="1024" src="https://149940842.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Vest-937x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1027" srcset="https://149940842.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Vest-937x1024.png 937w , https://149940842.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Vest-274x300.png 274w , https://149940842.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Vest-768x839.png 768w , https://149940842.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Vest-1405x1536.png 1405w , https://149940842.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Vest.png 1634w " sizes="(max-width: 937px) 100vw, 937px" /></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Vest</h3>



<p>Salomon ADV Skin 5<br>£120</p>



<p>This may be the best piece of equipment I&#8217;ve ever bought! It&#8217;s expensive but I&#8217;ve used it hundreds of times over the last 7 years so in terms of value for money, it&#8217;s well worth it.</p>



<p>I tried every type of band, belt and bag before spending the money on a vest and they were all terrible for me. I hated the feeling of bands and belts bouncing around and the bag I had didn&#8217;t fit snugly.</p>



<p>Vests have all the space you need to carry essential equipment for general running and for organised races. Pockets are easy to access and flasks are stored on the chest.</p>



<p>I keep a first aid kit and emergency sleeping bag in the rear pockets and use the front pockets to store other accessories that I take on and off during a run.</p>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-group ggimg has-global-padding is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Flask</h3>



<p>Salomon Soft Flask 500ml<br>£18</p>



<p>I bought this to make sure it fit in my vest but cheaper options are available. The newer Salomon flasks have 42mm wide necks to make it easier to fill and use with electrolyte tablets. I use it with a longer straw to make it easier to drink from.</p>



<p>The bottle shrinks as you drink so the remaining water doesn&#8217;t slosh around. They don&#8217;t last forever, my original one eventually developed a leak but it was at least 6 or 7 years old.</p>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-group ggimg has-global-padding is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="613" src="https://149940842.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Hat-1024x613.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1021" srcset="https://149940842.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Hat-1024x613.png 1024w , https://149940842.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Hat-300x179.png 300w , https://149940842.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Hat-768x460.png 768w , https://149940842.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Hat.png 1317w " sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Hat</h3>



<p>VÅGA “Club Cap”<br>£30</p>



<p>You&#8217;ve probably seen these everywhere and wondered what the big deal is. I succumbed to the hype and bought one to see for myself.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a great hat. It&#8217;s light and comfortable. I was worried the peak might be too short to protect my eyes from the sun but I wore it last summer and it was fine.</p>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-group has-global-padding is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Gloves</h3>



<p>I&#8217;ve had a pair of Ronhill gloves for ages and I can&#8217;t remember what they cost. They&#8217;re very basic and fine for a couple of hours out in the Welsh winter.</p>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-group has-global-padding is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained">
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Buff</h3>



<p>Buff<br>£10-15</p>



<p>This is another item that may have been a present so I didn&#8217;t get it for a specific feature. The brand is &#8220;Buff&#8221; and it&#8217;s a buff.</p>
</div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Tech</h2>



<div class="wp-block-group ggimg has-global-padding is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="340" height="563" src="https://149940842.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Watch.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1028" srcset="https://149940842.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Watch.png 340w , https://149940842.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Watch-181x300.png 181w " sizes="(max-width: 340px) 100vw, 340px" /></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Watch</h3>



<p>Garmin Forerunner 245<br>£250</p>



<p>This is another major purchase that a lot of runners use. Some people don&#8217;t want all the stats and fancy features of running watches but if you do this is a great model. (It&#8217;s been replaced with the newer 255.)</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve worn this everyday for nearly 5 years. It has basic smartphone notifications and some simple controls. I upgraded from a more basic version to have more data available during a run.</p>



<p>This is a low to mid-range watch. You can spend up to £1,000 for more advanced models and even more for luxury versions!</p>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-group ggimg has-global-padding is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="303" height="192" src="https://149940842.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Torch.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1026" srcset="https://149940842.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Torch.png 303w , https://149940842.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Torch-300x190.png 300w " sizes="(max-width: 303px) 100vw, 303px" /></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Head torch</h3>



<p>Fenix HL32R-T<br>£80</p>



<p>This is my most recent purchase. I&#8217;ve joined some local groups for evening trail runs and a good head torch is essential.</p>



<p>This is another example of choosing equipment suitable for my needs. There are more expensive models if you&#8217;re running overnight during ultra marathons and need a bigger battery capacity.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve used this a few times now and it&#8217;s perfect. The light is powerful and it&#8217;s comfy to wear. The band is also highly reflective. It&#8217;s got a rechargeable and replaceable battery, which was an important requirement.</p>



<p>The headband is wide and uses a &#8220;BOA&#8221; adjustable fitting system. This means you can tighten it easily to reduce bounce.</p>
</div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Safety</h2>



<div class="wp-block-group ggimg has-global-padding is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="570" height="480" src="https://149940842.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/First-aid-kit.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1019" srcset="https://149940842.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/First-aid-kit.png 570w , https://149940842.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/First-aid-kit-300x253.png 300w " sizes="(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px" /></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">First Aid Kit</h3>



<p>Lifesystems “Nano”<br>£15</p>



<p>If you enter a trail race, a first aid kit will normally be essential equipment so it&#8217;s good to have one. I keep mine in my vest at all times.</p>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-group ggimg has-global-padding is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="608" height="358" src="https://149940842.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Sleeping-bag.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1024" srcset="https://149940842.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Sleeping-bag.png 608w , https://149940842.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Sleeping-bag-300x177.png 300w " sizes="(max-width: 608px) 100vw, 608px" /></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Emergency Sleeping Bag</h3>



<p>Shayson<br>£8</p>



<p>This is another piece of essential equipment. It&#8217;s something you hope you&#8217;ll never need but you&#8217;ll be glad you have if something goes wrong. I used to carry a space blanket but I read that a sleeping bag is far better.</p>

<p>Another Thursday Night Trail session with the <a href="https://www.cdfrunners.co.uk/">CDF Runners</a> tonight.</p>



<p>These routes are close to me so I&#8217;ve been incorporating a pre and post run to get some miles in. I made my way up to Fforest Ganol to get this shot across the fields while there was still some colour in the sky.</p>



<p>I met up with the group in Fforest Fawr and we set off for just over 6 miles around the forest and into the Wenallt.</p>



<p>There were some good sections, good chat and very good doggies. The trails were rock solid and the silvery frost sparkled under the light of my head torch.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve done a couple of longer runs now and I&#8217;ve been feeling good.</p>

<p>Short run down the canal today at an easy pace.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m not very good at slowing down and just enjoying the run on flatter routes. It&#8217;s not because I&#8217;m trying to beat a time or look good on Strava.</p>



<p>I have a medium pace that feels comfortable but I know this is more effort than I need to exert and that a slower pace would be good for me.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve seen people doing &#8220;low HR&#8221; training and experts seem to agree there are some benefits. So I kept an eye on my heart rate and tried to keep it low while reducing my pace.</p>

<p>I struggled with this long solo run at first. I&#8217;ve really enjoyed running in a group recently and I lacked some motivation for the first few miles.</p>



<p>Once I reached the Garth, I felt much better. The feeling of freedom and adventure took hold and I got into the groove of planning which route to take and just enjoying the views.</p>



<p>I started thinking about motivation and what keeps me running. I recently told a friend that a few years ago, I stopped thinking of myself as &#8220;someone who runs&#8221; and now I strongly identify as &#8220;a runner&#8221;.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve never run competitively or at a high level but I&#8217;ve run regularly for just over 10 years and I think about it all the time!</p>



<p>A large part of being able to run regularly is luck. I&#8217;m really lucky that I live somewhere with access to the trails. I&#8217;m not sure if I&#8217;d run as much if I had to travel to reach them.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve also been really lucky with injuries. I&#8217;ve had a couple of the classics, but after taking a break and resting I managed to recover. I still get a few niggles, which cause me a fair amount of anxiety, but I&#8217;m really good at rest days.</p>



<p>One of my goals this year is to do some strength and flexibility training. I actually did 30 minutes of yoga before this run. (I find yoga really hard!)</p>

<p>The lights in the valley were sparkling as we made our way down Craig yr Allt after a recce for the upcoming trail race.</p>

<p>There were some muddy sections but the trails have dried out a lot after a few days of dry weather.</p>

<p>I joined the &#8220;Thursday Night Trails&#8221; for my first run with the <a href="https://www.cdfrunners.co.uk/">CDF Runners</a> tonight.</p>



<p>We met in Fforest Fawr car park and split into two groups. One short route and one longer route.</p>



<p>I follow a few of the group on social media so I knew some faces. It was quite strange seeing them in person for the first time.</p>



<p>The conditions were still boggy but it was dry and mild out. I really need to get a better head torch though. My old one doesn&#8217;t provide enough light to run with confidence.</p>



<p>Despite this, it was a lovely group and I had a good chat while we negotiated the trails.</p>



<p>We met up with the other group and had a brief chat before heading home.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re interested in running with CDF Runners, head over to <a href="https://www.cdfrunners.co.uk/training/">the CDF Runners website</a>.</p>

New Year&#8217;s Day is always busy with walkers and the weather hadn&#8217;t put people off. Fforest Fawr was packed with families out enjoying the fresh air. The forecast was pretty good, but unfortunately wrong! It was very overcast [&#8230;]]]></description>

<p>I wasn&#8217;t planning to go out today but I found myself kitted up with some free time.</p>



<p>New Year&#8217;s Day is always busy with walkers and the weather hadn&#8217;t put people off. Fforest Fawr was packed with families out enjoying the fresh air.</p>



<p>The forecast was pretty good, but unfortunately wrong! It was very overcast and wet.</p>



<p>I took it easy because I was out quite a bit last week and I&#8217;ve got another group run lined up for later this week. The last thing I want to do is start the year with an injury.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t keep track of these statistics during the year and it was quite a surprise when it turned out 2023 was almost the same as 2022.</p>



<p>Perhaps this means I&#8217;ve discovered my ideal amount of running. Or maybe it means I&#8217;m stuck in a rut?</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t enter many races and, because I&#8217;m always on the trails, I&#8217;m not chasing PBs. This amount of running keeps me active and fits into my family life.</p>



<p>I do a small amount of indoor cycling and do some walking with my camera.</p>

<p>The biggest increase is the number of shoes I&#8217;ve bought! I decided earlier in the year to try and get some experience of different brands.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve discovered the type of shoe that suits my feet but I&#8217;m still going to try and pick up some more different brands this year.</p>

<p>I went out with a <a href="https://cardifftrails.com/groups/" data-type="page" data-id="254">few groups</a> last year and I&#8217;m going to make the effort to do more this year. I love  running with a group and we&#8217;re spoiled in Cardiff with all the options available.</p>

<p>I finished off the year with a muddy group run.</p>



<p>The Running Punks &#8220;Sunday Clwb&#8221; was meeting in Radyr so I headed over to join them for my final run of 2023.</p>



<p>The rain looked like it was going to hold off but as we got warmed up it started tipping down. The weather didn&#8217;t affect the mood though as we headed back to Ton.</p>



<p>It can be miserable running alone in the rain but when you&#8217;ve got loads of people to chat with you don&#8217;t even notice it. We took it easy and enjoyed the route by the Glamorganshire Canal and through Hailey Park.</p>



<p>We came back though some trails I&#8217;ve never run before and finished back in Radyr.</p>
